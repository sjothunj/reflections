How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	It you can pinpoint the line in question, spotting the error is far easier. Once the line has been identified, doing a character by character comparison is manageable and, for some bugs, necessary to identify the issue.

	It would make it easier to spot a difference and would also encouraging thinking about changes/additions that are made as logical blocks which should help in the design phase.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros are that you can be pretty sure that when you manually choose, you have a logical milestone of a workable build. The con is that you are you have to rely on yourself to remember to make that commit and to document it accordingly.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    The tools that allow multiple files are usually associated with software or website development where multiple files define a discrete body of work. With Google Docs, for example, there isn't any logical association between separate files except ones that a user would manually enforce.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log presents a nice digest of each commit that you can then use git diff to view the details of what has changed

	Granular control would be best, especially as the size of a commit is not based on lines changed or character count. Size is relative/contextual.
